# Greetings and Salutations, I'm Gabriel Mack 🌟

🎶 On GitHub I've landed, with code and fun packed,
To the world of git pushes, I'm no longer untracked.
I'm Gabriel Mack, with a knack for the code,
In the realm of the web, where my creations have glowed.

## 🎮 Gamer's Verse

In the land of Terraria, with mods aplenty,
I roam and I craft, my adventures not empty.
Minecraft's my canvas, with blocks wide and far,
Crafting and building, beneath square sun and stars.

## 💻 Code in Cadence

JavaScript's my instrument, my artful expression,
Crafting loops and functions, with careful discretion.
Each line a verse, in a symphony of semicolons,
Creating, innovating, like digital Apollos.

## 🌐 Connect in Couplets

Let's weave through the code, in patterns that rhyme,
Share ideas and projects, through the annals of time.
Fork, clone, and star, let's collaborate with zest,
In this hub of creation, we're all among the best.

---

Thank you for stopping by, do explore and see,
The code that I've written, shared with thee.
If modded game worlds or JavaScript is your delight,
Star my repos, let's code into the night!
